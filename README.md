# TimeSeriesOfTemps

This project practiced correcting time series data for seasonality and analyzing it. The data contained minimum daily temperatures with the dates. I used the additive model which is used when the variations around the trend do not vary with the level of the time series. Here the components of a time series are simply added together using the formula:

y(t) = Level(t) + Trend(t) + Seasonality(t) + Noise(t)

- Trend: The increasing or decreasing value in the series.
- Seasonality: The repeating short-term cycle in the series.
- Noise: The random variation in the series.

When I plotted just the trend line, the graph seemed to indicate that the temperature was increasing slightly through the decade. But when comparing the trend line to the plot of temperatures, the rise seems insignificant. Of course, more than a decade and more than one location would be needed to truely make any conclusions.
